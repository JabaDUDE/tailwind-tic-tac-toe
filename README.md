# My Awesome Project
I decided to create a simple tic-tac-toe game with Tom and Jerry!

**Link to project:** https://jabadude.github.io/tailwind-tic-tac-toe/



## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TailwindCSS

I made tic-tac-toe before with a follow along and wanted to try to rebuild it with whatever knowledge I gained since last time I attempted WHILE practicing TailwindCSS (this is the first
project I attempted to make with it).

## Optimizations

A lot of my code was refactored during the process as the readability of the code became worse. I always tried, as best I could, to comment each step and show what each 
part of my code did. This allows anyone going in to look at it to easily see the 'who, what, when, where, how' of what's happening. 


## Lessons Learned:

I learned a lot about TailWindCSS through this project.
